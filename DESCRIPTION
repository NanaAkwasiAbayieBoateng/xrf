Package: xrf
Title: eXtreme RuleFit
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Karl", "Holub", email = "karljholub@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package is an implementation of the RuleFit algorithm. eXtreme Gradient Boosting ('XGBoost') is used 
  to build rules, and 'glmnet' is used to fit a sparse linear model on the raw and rule features. The end result
  is a model that learns similarly to a tree ensemble, while often offering improved interpretability
  and achieving improved scoring runtime in live applications. xrf provides several algorithms for
  reducing rule complexity, most notably hyperrectangle de-overlapping. xrf's algorithms scale to several million
  rows and support sparse representations to handle tens of thousands of dimensions.
