Title: Fit eXtreme RuleFit models
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Karl", "Holub", email = "karljholub@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: An implementation of the RuleFit algorithm. eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is used 
  to build rules, and glmnet is used to fit a sparse linear model on input and rule features. 
  Additionally, xrf provides an algorithm for hyperrectangle deoverlapping, used after rule generation
  and before linear model fitting, to put rules sharing subspaces into mutual exclusion.
